JSLibrary started off as a replacement for the Park library, but has since added extra classes not found in Park. The library in its
current form contains classes related to interface elements, dynamic data structures and utility methods.

There are four packages within the JSLibrary. <code>js</code> contains classes designed to be used individually throughout a program.
<code>dynamic</code> contains the dynamic data structure classes. <code>preferences</code> contains all the classes required to create
Mac OS X style Preferences windows for a program. <code>incomplete</code> contains classes which are more or less finished, but may
still contain a few bugs, and these classes have not yet been fully documented.
