JSLibrary is a Java library I created to help with A Level Computing. It takes common tasks, such as creating JTables, and simplifies them immensely. I can't take all the credit, though; most of the code is based on the Park Library created by my computing teacher.

INSTALLATION
------------

Installation is simple. Just download the JAR file and copy it into your Java project folder.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

Once the JAR is in your project folder, you should be able to use any of the classes included by typing "import js.*;" at the top of your class file.

If you have trouble, it may be that you need to add the library to the build path. If you're using Eclipse, right-click the JAR file in the Navigation panel and choose Build Path > Add to Build Path. From there, it should work fine.
