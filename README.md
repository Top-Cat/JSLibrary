JSLibrary is a Java library I created to help with A Level Computing. It takes common tasks, such as creating JTables, and simplifies them immensely. I can't take all the credit, though; most of the code is based on the Park Library created by my computing teacher.

There are some issues with the current release of some of the classes. See the 'Issues' tab above for more info.

### INSTALLATION ###

Installation is simple. Just download the JAR file and copy it into your Java project folder.

The source code is also available, but you don't need that to actually use the classes in your project. Feel free to edit the source code as you see fit.

### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS ###

Once the JAR is in your project folder, you should be able to use any of the classes included by typing `import js.*;` at the top of your class file. Or, if you use Eclipse, you can automatically import any classes you use using `⌘+⇧+O`.

If you have trouble, it may be that you need to add the library to the build path. If you're using Eclipse, right-click the JAR file in the Navigation panel and choose Build Path > Add to Build Path. From there, it should work fine.
